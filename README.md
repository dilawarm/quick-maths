# Python Template

A basic Python project template that actually works. Nothing fancy, just the stuff you need to get going.

## What's in here

This template gives you a Python 3.12 project with:

- **uv** for dependency management (it's fast)
- **pytest** for testing
- **ruff** for linting and formatting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **Docker** setup that actually builds
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Makefile** for common tasks

## Getting started

Clone this template and make it your own:

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-project>
```

or just click the `Use this template` button.

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv run make install
```

That's it. You're ready to code.

## Development

The main code goes in `python_template/`. There's already a simple function in `main.py` to get you started.

### Common commands

```bash
# Install everything
uv run make install

# Run tests
uv run make test

# Check your code (linting + type checking)
uv run make check

# Fix formatting issues
uv run make fix

# Run tests with coverage
uv run make coverage
```

### Adding dependencies

Add them to `pyproject.toml` and run:

```bash
uv lock
uv sync
```

## Docker

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t python-template .

# Run it
docker run -it python-template /bin/bash

# Run tests in Docker
docker run --rm python-template uv run make test
```

## Testing

Tests go in the `tests/` folder. The template includes a basic test to make sure everything works.

Run tests:

```bash
uv run make test
```

Get coverage:

```bash
uv run make coverage
```

## Code quality

The template enforces code quality with:

- **ruff** for linting and formatting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **pre-commit** hooks (optional but recommended)

Check everything:

```bash
uv run make check
```

Fix formatting:

```bash
uv run make fix
```

## GitHub Actions

Three workflows are set up:

- **CI**: Runs on every push/PR. Tests your code, checks formatting, runs security scans.
- **Docker**: Builds and publishes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry.
- **Release**: Creates releases when you push version tags.

Just push your code and everything runs automatically.

### Making a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This triggers the release workflow and publishes your Docker image.

That's pretty much it. This template handles the boring setup stuff so you can focus on writing code. Change the name in `pyproject.toml`, update this README, and start building.
